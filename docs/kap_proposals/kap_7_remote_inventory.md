# Remote Inventory Federation

This feature would add the ability to Kapitan to fetch parts of the inventory from remote locations (https/git). This would allow users to combine different inventories from different sources and build modular infrastructure reusable across various repos.

## Specification

The configuration and declaration of remote inventories would be done in the hidden file `â€‹.kapitan`.

The file specifications are as follows:

```yaml
remoteInventory:
    -   name: <inventory_name> #user defined
        type: <inventory_type> #git\https
        source: <source_of_inventory>
        output_path: <relative_output_path>
        ... type specific arguments
```

The command for fetching a specific remote inventory declared in inventory configuration files will be:
``` $ kapitan inventory --fetch <inventory-name> ```

The command for fetching all the inventories declared in inventory configuration files will be:
```$ kapitan inventory --fetch-all```

## Copying inventory files to the output location
The output path is the path to save the inventory items into. The path is relative to the `inventory/` directory. For example, it could be `/classes/`. The contents of the fetched inventory will be recursively copied.

The fetched inventory files will be cached in the `.kapitan_cache` directory.

## Force fetching
While fetching, the output path will be recursively checked to see if it contains any file with the same name. If so, kapitan will raise an error saying so.

To overwrite the files with the newly downloaded inventory items, we can add the --force flag to the fetch command, as shown below.

`$ kapitan inventory --fetch-all --force`
`$ kapitan inventory --fetch <inventory-name> --force`

## URL type
The URL type (Http/git) will be inferred from the <source> address. Depending on the URL type, the configuration file may have additional arguments.

E.g Git type may also include aditional `ref` parameter as illustrated below:

```yaml
remoteInventory:
    -   name: <inventory_name> #user defined
        type: <inventory_type> #git\https
        source: <source_of_inventory>
        output_path: <relative_output_path>
        ref: <commit_hash/branch/tag>
```
